# Fox Trap

Fox Trap is a modular, wireless mesh based Command and Control infrastructure for locating mobile rogue access points, and conducting wireless red team ops in the field. The current implementation 

scans for target BSSIDs from a list of targets, 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
